Privacy Policy

I, the developer of High Society Checkout ("I", "my", or "me"), operate the "High Society Checkout" mobile application (the "Service").

Information Collection and Use
I do not collect, store, or process any personal information from users. The app does not send any data to servers or third parties.

Optional Email for Backup
The app allows users to provide an email address solely for the purpose of sending backups.
This email address is not collected, stored, or shared with anyone.
The email is used only locally within the app to send backups directly to the userâ€™s specified email address as JSON sqlite-dumps.

Third-Party Services
I do not use any third-party services that collect data, such as analytics or advertising, nor does the app communicate with external servers.

Security
Since no data is collected or transmitted, there are no security risks related to data breaches or unauthorized access through my app.

Changes to This Privacy Policy
I may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page. This policy is effective as of [date].
